# Implementation Plan: Savings Tracker & LocalStack Integration

## Overview

This plan implements four sub-features for the Cloud Janitor project: a persistent savings ledger, LocalStack wiring for demo-mode Terraform execution, a SPEC_COMPLIANCE.md generator script, and a streaming agent reasoning logger with Streamlit panel. Tasks are ordered to build foundational components first (savings tracker, reasoning logger), then infrastructure (LocalStack, Makefile), then integration (orchestrator wiring, Streamlit panel), and finally the compliance generator.

## Tasks

- [x] 4. LocalStack wiring and demo infrastructure
  - [x] 4.1 Replace `terraform` with `tflocal` in `mcp_server/aws_janitor_mcp.py`
    - Change `["terraform", "init", "-backend=false"]` to `["tflocal", "init", "-backend=false"]`
    - Change `["terraform", "validate"]` to `["tflocal", "validate"]`
    - _Requirements: 6.1_

  - [x] 4.2 Replace `terraform` with `tflocal` in `hooks/pre-remediation.sh`
    - Replace all occurrences of `terraform -chdir=` with `tflocal -chdir=`
    - _Requirements: 6.1_

  - [x] 4.3 Create `docker-compose.yml` at project root
    - Define `localstack` service with `localstack/localstack:latest` image
    - Expose port 4566, set SERVICES=ec2,elasticache,s3,ebs, DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
    - Mount Docker socket volume
    - _Requirements: 6.3_

  - [x] 4.4 Create `Makefile` at project root with `demo` target
    - Run `docker-compose up -d` to start LocalStack
    - Poll LocalStack health endpoint (`http://localhost:4566/_localstack/health`) every 2s, max 30 attempts with progress dots
    - Launch Streamlit dashboard via `streamlit run app.py` as the final step
    - The Makefile SHALL NOT invoke `tflocal apply` directly — the apply happens inside `orchestrator.py` when the user types `APPROVE <resource-id>` through the Streamlit UI
    - Exit non-zero with error message if health check exceeds 60 seconds
    - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_

  - [x] 4.5 Wire `tflocal apply -auto-approve` into orchestrator approval flow
    - In `orchestrator.py` `approve()` method, insert the `tflocal apply` call AFTER `_run_pre_remediation_hook()` returns None (success) and BEFORE `_run_post_remediation_hook()` is called
    - The execution sequence in `approve()` is: (1) validate input → (2) `_run_pre_remediation_hook()` (tflocal validate) → (3) **INSERT `tflocal apply -auto-approve` HERE** → (4) `_run_post_remediation_hook()` (audit.log) → (5) `_savings_tracker.record_run()`
    - Output directory for `tflocal apply` is `self.project_root / "output"` (where `remediation.tf` lives)
    - Code to insert:

      ```python
      apply_result = subprocess.run(
          ["tflocal", "apply", "-auto-approve"],
          capture_output=True,
          text=True,
          timeout=120,
          cwd=str(self.project_root / "output"),
      )
      if apply_result.returncode != 0:
          error = apply_result.stderr.strip() or apply_result.stdout.strip()
          return ApprovalResult(
              success=False,
              message=f"tflocal apply failed: {error}",
              resource_id=plan.resource_id,
          )
      ```

    - If `tflocal apply` returns non-zero exit code, surface stderr as error message and halt pipeline without proceeding to post-remediation hook or savings tracking
    - This is triggered exclusively by the user typing `APPROVE <resource-id>` in the UI, NOT by the Makefile
    - _Requirements: 6.4, 6.5_

  - [x] 4.6 Update `requirements.txt` to add `terraform-local`
    - Add `terraform-local>=0.18.0` to requirements.txt
    - _Requirements: 6.2_

    - Import and instantiate `SavingsTracker` in `Orchestrator.__init__`
    - Call `self._savings_tracker.record_run(resources_remediated=[resource_id])` in `approve()` method after successful execution, after `_run_post_remediation_hook`
    - Ensure `record_run` is NOT called from `_run_post_remediation_hook` to avoid double-counting
    - Handle `FileNotFoundError` and `OSError` from savings tracker gracefully (log warning, don't block approval)
    - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

  - [x] 5.2 Add ReasoningLogger truncation at audit start in Orchestrator
    - Instantiate ReasoningLogger in Orchestrator and call `truncate()` at the beginning of `execute_audit()`
    - Pass the shared logger instance to each agent
    - _Requirements: 9.5_

  - [x] 5.3 Write unit tests for Orchestrator → SavingsTracker wiring
    - Verify `record_run()` is called from `approve()` with correct arguments
    - Verify `record_run()` is NOT called from `_run_post_remediation_hook`
    - Verify savings tracker errors don't block approval
    - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 6. Update .gitignore and project configuration
  - [x] 6.1 Add runtime files to `.gitignore`
    - Add `savings_ledger.json` to `.gitignore`
    - Add `agent_reasoning.log` to `.gitignore`
    - _Requirements: 1.4, 9.8_

    - Implement keyword-to-file mapping table per requirements 8.3
    - Verify file existence for done tasks
    - Output `SPEC_COMPLIANCE.md` as a 4-column Markdown table with columns: `#`, `Task`, `Status`, `Artifact Verified`
    - Exit with non-zero code if tasks.md is missing
    - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5_

  - [x] 8.2 Create Git post-commit hook
    - Create `.git/hooks/post-commit` that runs `python3 scripts/generate_spec_compliance.py && git add SPEC_COMPLIANCE.md`
    - Make the hook executable
    - _Requirements: 8.6_

  - [x] 8.3 Write property test: Compliance generator parsing and mapping
    - **Property 6: Compliance generator parsing and mapping**
    - **Validates: Requirements 8.2, 8.3**

  - [x] 8.4 Write property test: Compliance generator output format
    - **Property 7: Compliance generator output format**
    - Verify output is a valid 4-column Markdown table with headers: `#`, `Task`, `Status`, `Artifact Verified`
    - **Validates: Requirements 8.4**

- [x] 9. Implement Streamlit Reasoning Panel
  - [x] 9.1 Add reasoning log panel to `app.py`

    - Implement fallback polling with background thread for older Streamlit
    - Read `agent_reasoning.log`, parse JSONL, skip malformed lines silently
    - Color-code events: check=#9e9e9e, finding=#ff9800, skip=#bdbdbd, decision=#2196f3, handoff=bold
    - Insert section headers when agent name changes between consecutive events
    - Auto-scroll to latest event during audit execution
    - Clear previous reasoning display when new audit starts
    - _Requirements: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6_

  - [x] 9.2 Write property test: Agent section header transitions
    - **Property 10: Agent section header transitions**
    - **Validates: Requirements 10.3**

  - [x] 9.3 Write property test: Malformed line resilience
    - **Property 11: Malformed line resilience**
    - **Validates: Requirements 10.6**

- [x] 10. Final checkpoint — test quality audit

  - [x] 10.1 Run full test suite and confirm all tests pass
    - Run `pytest` from project root
    - All tests must pass before proceeding to 10.2

  - [x] 10.2 Run test quality audit on all test files
    - Review every test file in `tests/` and `test_fixture.py` with the
      following mandate:

      You are a hostile code reviewer whose only job is to find tests
      that cannot catch bugs. For each test, ask: "If I deliberately
      broke the thing this test claims to test, would this test fail?"
      If the answer is no, the test is wrong.

      Flag and rewrite every test that exhibits any of these patterns:

      1. TAUTOLOGICAL — test asserts the output of the function equals
         the output of the function
         Bad:  assert result == savings_tracker.record_run(...)
         Good: assert result["run_id"] == "086a8f10-..."

      2. PASS-BY-DEFAULT — test passes even if the function returns
         None or an empty list
         Bad:  assert len(result) >= 0
         Good: assert len(result) == 2

      3. WRONG FIXTURE — test uses a fixture that has no flaggable
         resources, so the function could return [] and the test still
         passes
         Fix: every test fixture must contain at least one item that
         SHOULD be flagged and verify it appears in output with correct
         fields

      4. MISSING NEGATIVE CASES — no test for what should NOT happen
         Required negative tests for this codebase:
         - FinOps Auditor must NOT flag resources idle < 7 days
           (dev-test-server, 3 days idle in fixture)
         - Approval gate must NOT accept any string other than
           "APPROVE <exact-resource-id>"
         - Remediation Architect must NOT generate HCL before
           dependency check completes
         - Rollback HCL must NOT be identical to remediation HCL
         - SavingsTracker must NOT update total_lifetime_savings when
           duplicate run_id is detected (mtime must be unchanged)
         - ReasoningLogger must NOT crash on filesystem errors —
           agent execution must continue

      5. MOCKED AWAY — test mocks the exact thing being tested
         Bad:  mock_tracker.record_run.return_value = True
               assert mock_tracker.record_run() == True
         Good: mock only external I/O (file reads, subprocess calls),
               never the unit under test

      6. NO SCHEMA VALIDATION — findings_store.json tests don't verify
         required fields
         Required: every finding must have id, resource_id,
         resource_type, agent, category, severity, title, description,
         cost_estimate_monthly, idle_days, metadata, detected_at
         Test must fail if any field is missing or has wrong type

      7. PROPERTY TEST TAUTOLOGY — Hypothesis test generates data and
         passes it through the function, then asserts the output equals
         what the function returned (not what it should return)
         Bad:  result = tracker.record_run(resources)
               assert result == tracker.record_run(resources)
         Good: assert ledger["total_lifetime_savings"] == sum(
                   r["monthly_savings_added"] for r in ledger["runs"]
               )

      For each broken test: explain why it cannot catch a bug, then
      rewrite it so it can. Do not add new tests — fix existing ones.

      After fixing, run the full test suite. If anything now fails that
      was previously passing, that is a SUCCESS — it means we found a
      test that was lying. Report those failures explicitly as:
      "Found lying test: <name> — it now correctly fails because
      <reason>".

  - [x] 10.3 Verify no hardcoded `terraform` or `tflocal` binary calls remain
    - Run: `grep -rn '"terraform"' mcp_server/ .kiro/hooks/ orchestrator.py`
    - Run: `grep -rn '"tflocal"' mcp_server/ .kiro/hooks/ orchestrator.py`
    - Both must return zero matches
    - All Terraform invocations must use the TF_CMD environment variable
      (default: "tflocal" for demo mode, override to "terraform" for real AWS)
    - Verify TF_CMD is documented in mcp_server/README.md and Makefile comments

  - [x] 10.4 Verify runtime files excluded from git
    - Run: `git check-ignore -v savings_ledger.json agent_reasoning.log`
    - Both files must be ignored

  - [-] 10.5 Run scripts/generate_spec_compliance.py and commit output
    - Run: `python3 scripts/generate_spec_compliance.py`
    - Verify SPEC_COMPLIANCE.md is generated without errors
    - Commit SPEC_COMPLIANCE.md

## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for faster MVP
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Checkpoints ensure incremental validation
- Property tests validate universal correctness properties from the design document
- Unit tests validate specific examples and edge cases
- The implementation language is Python, matching the existing codebase
- `hypothesis` is already in requirements.txt for property-based testing
- All agents already exist — tasks 2.2–2.4 modify existing files to add emit calls
- **Key design constraint**: `tflocal apply -auto-approve` is triggered exclusively by `orchestrator.py` when the user types `APPROVE <resource-id>` — the Makefile only starts LocalStack and launches Streamlit
- **Property 8 testing note**: Use `st.text(alphabet=st.characters(blacklist_categories=('Cs',)))` for agent/message fields to cover quotes, backslashes, and unicode — not just default ASCII
