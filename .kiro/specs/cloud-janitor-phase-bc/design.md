# Design Document: Cloud Janitor Phase B+C (AI & Platform Features)

## Overview

This design covers 9 features spanning Phase B (Tier 2 AI Features) and Phase C (Tier 3 Platform Features) for the Cloud Janitor project. Phase B introduces LLM-powered intelligence via Anthropic's claude-haiku-4-5 model — natural language querying, remediation explanations, policy suggestions, auto-tagging, and anomaly detection. Phase C adds platform capabilities — policy generation from incidents, drift detection with narrative, multi-account orchestration, and scheduled scans.

All AI agents follow the same architectural pattern: a dedicated class in `agents/`, a corresponding `@mcp.tool()` in `aws_janitor_mcp.py`, direct import (no network transport), safe-default error handling (never raise from AI), and session state caching in `app.py`. The existing pipeline (FinOps → SecOps → Remediation Architect) remains unchanged; new features integrate as pre-scan filters, post-scan enrichments, or independent workflows.

The implementation uses `JANITOR_BACKEND=fixture` compatibility throughout, ensuring all features work without live AWS credentials during development and testing.

## Components and Interfaces

### Component 1: QueryInterpreter (Phase B)

**Purpose**: Maps free-text natural language queries to structured scan parameters using claude-haiku-4-5.

**Interface**:

```python
class QueryInterpreter:
    def __init__(self, model: str = "claude-haiku-4-5"):
        ...

    def interpret(self, query: str) -> dict:
        """
        Parse NL query into structured scan parameters.

        Returns:
            {
                "resource_types": list[str],    # empty list = all types
                "check_types": list[str],       # empty list = all checks
                "min_idle_days": int,           # default 7
                "intent_summary": str,          # one sentence, shown in UI
                "confidence": float             # 0.0–1.0
            }
        """
        ...
```

**Responsibilities**:

- Parse free-text into structured parameters via LLM
- Return safe defaults on LLM failure (all resources, all checks, min_idle_days=7, confidence=0.0, intent_summary="Could not interpret query.")
- Validate parsed parameters against known resource types (elasticache, ebs, ec2)
- Validate check_types against known checks (security_group, encryption, public_access)

---

### Component 2: RemediationExplainer (Phase B)

**Purpose**: Generates plain-English explanations for remediation plans, describing what will happen and why.

**Interface**:

```python
class RemediationExplainer:
    def __init__(self, model: str = "claude-haiku-4-5"):
        ...

    def explain(self, resource_id: str, finding: dict, remediation_hcl: str, rollback_hcl: str) -> dict:
        """
        Generate explanation for a remediation plan.

        Args:
            resource_id: The resource being remediated
            finding: The finding dict that triggered remediation
            remediation_hcl: The generated Terraform HCL for the fix
            rollback_hcl: The generated Terraform HCL for rollback

        Returns:
            {
                "risk_explanation": str,         # Why this finding is dangerous (2-3 sentences)
                "what_terraform_does": str,      # What the remediation HCL will change (2-3 sentences)
                "what_rollback_restores": str,   # What rollback will undo (1-2 sentences)
            }
        """
        ...
```

**Responsibilities**:

- Explain why a finding is risky in plain English
- Describe what the Terraform remediation will change
- Describe what the rollback will restore
- max_tokens: 400 — this is a UI panel, not a report
- Never raise — return all three keys populated with "Explanation unavailable." on failure

---

### Component 3: PolicySuggester (Phase B)

**Purpose**: After a scan, suggests 3-5 additional policy checks the user might want to enable based on findings patterns.

**Interface**:

```python
class PolicySuggester:
    def __init__(self, model: str = "claude-haiku-4-5"):
        ...

    def suggest(self, findings: list[dict], already_checked: list[str]) -> list[dict]:
        """
        Suggest additional policies based on scan findings.

        Args:
            findings: the findings list from findings_store.json
            already_checked: list of check_types already run (e.g. ["security_group", "encryption"])

        Returns a flat list of up to 5 suggestion dicts:
            [
                {
                    "suggestion_id": str,       # slug, e.g. "check-rds-encryption"
                    "title": str,               # short display name
                    "rationale": str,           # one sentence explaining why
                    "query": str,               # natural language query to pass to QueryInterpreter
                    "priority": "high" | "medium" | "low"
                }
            ]
        """
        ...
```

**Responsibilities**:

- Analyze finding patterns to suggest related checks
- Do not suggest check_types already in already_checked
- Return 3-5 suggestions ranked by priority
- If findings is empty, return a sensible default set of suggestions
- Never raise — return [] on failure

---

### Component 4: ResourceTagger (Phase B)

**Purpose**: Infers environment/team/owner context from resource names, IDs, and metadata patterns.

**Interface**:

```python
class ResourceTagger:
    def __init__(self, model: str = "claude-haiku-4-5", confidence_threshold: float = 0.7):
        ...

    def infer(self, resource_id: str, resource_name: str, existing_tags: dict | None = None) -> dict:
        """
        Infer tagging context for a single resource.

        Args:
            resource_id: The AWS resource ID
            resource_name: Human-readable resource name
            existing_tags: Already-known tags (skips inference for present fields)

        Returns:
            {
                "env": "production" | "staging" | "development" | "unknown",
                "team": str | None,       # e.g. "platform", None if undetectable
                "owner": str | None,      # e.g. "backend-team", None if undetectable
                "risk_level": "high" | "medium" | "low",
                "confidence": float       # 0.0–1.0
            }
        """
        ...

    def infer_batch(self, resources: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
        """
        Batch inference for multiple resources.
        Each resource dict has: {resource_id, resource_name, existing_tags}
        Returns list of inference dicts in same order as input.
        Uses a single LLM call for up to 10 resources at once.
        """
        ...
```

**Responsibilities**:

- Parse resource naming conventions (prod-, staging-, dev- prefixes)
- Infer team/owner from naming patterns
- If existing_tags contains env/team/owner, skip inference for those fields
- If confidence < confidence_threshold, set team and owner to None
- env must always be one of: production, staging, development, unknown
- Support batch inference for efficiency (single LLM call for up to 10 resources)
- Never raise — return {env: "unknown", team: None, owner: None, risk_level: "low", confidence: 0.0} on failure

---

### Component 5: AnomalyDetector (Phase B)

**Purpose**: Flags suspicious resources not caught by rule-based checks. Integrates post-scan in orchestrator.

**Interface**:

```python
class AnomalyDetector:
    def __init__(self, model: str = "claude-haiku-4-5"):
        ...

    def detect(self, resources: list[dict], findings: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
        """
        Detect anomalies beyond rule-based findings.

        Args:
            resources: raw resource list from get_cost_data() and get_security_data()
            findings: already-identified findings from FinOps + SecOps agents

        Returns a flat list of anomaly dicts:
            [
                {
                    "anomaly_id": str,           # slug, e.g. "anomaly-001"
                    "resource_id": str,
                    "anomaly_type": str,         # e.g. "unusual_port", "naming_anomaly", "region_mismatch"
                    "description": str,          # plain English, 1-2 sentences
                    "severity": "high" | "medium" | "low",
                    "evidence": str              # specific detail that triggered this anomaly
                }
            ]
        """
        ...
```

**Responsibilities**:

- Compare resources against expected patterns
- Identify unusual port configs, naming anomalies, region mismatches, cost outliers
- Do NOT duplicate findings already in the findings list — check by resource_id
- Integrated into orchestrator post-scan pipeline
- Never raise — return [] on failure

---

### Component 6: IncidentPolicyGenerator (Phase C)

**Purpose**: Generates preventive scan policies from incident descriptions. Saves as JSON in `policies/` directory.

**Interface**:

```python
class IncidentPolicyGenerator:
    def __init__(self, model: str = "claude-haiku-4-5", policies_dir: Path | None = None):
        ...

    def generate(self, incident_description: str) -> list[dict]:
        """
        Generate preventive scan policies from an incident description.

        Args:
            incident_description: Plain text describing a past incident or near-miss.
                Empty/whitespace → returns [].
                Longer than 2000 chars → truncated before LLM call.

        Returns a list of policy dicts:
            [
                {
                    "policy_id": str,              # slug, e.g. "policy-s3-public-access-check"
                    "policy_name": str,
                    "resource_types": list[str],   # non-empty
                    "check_type": str,             # one of: security_group, encryption, public_access, idle_resource
                    "check_logic_description": str, # plain English
                    "rationale": str,              # why this policy prevents the incident
                    "query": str,                  # natural language query for QueryInterpreter
                    "generated_at": str,           # ISO timestamp
                    "incident_hash": str,          # sha256[:8] of incident_description
                    "version": 1
                }
            ]
        """
        ...

    def list_policies(self) -> list[dict]:
        """List all saved policies from policies/ directory."""
        ...
```

**Responsibilities**:

- Parse incident descriptions to identify preventive checks
- Generate 3-5 structured policy JSON dicts per incident
- Save each policy as: policies/{policy_id}.json
- Create policies/ directory if it does not exist
- If a policy with the same incident_hash already exists, skip writing (return existing)
- Input validation: empty/whitespace → []; >2000 chars → truncate
- Never raise — return [] on failure

---

### Component 7: DriftDetector (Phase C)

**Purpose**: Compares scan snapshots over time and generates LLM narrative explaining what changed. Uses atomic writes with filelock.

**Interface**:

```python
class DriftDetector:
    def __init__(
        self,
        history_path: Path | None = None,   # default: project_root/scan_history.json
        max_snapshots: int = 30,
        model: str = "claude-haiku-4-5",

        """
        Append a snapshot to scan_history.json.
        Schema: {scan_id, timestamp, findings, anomalies, total_waste}
        Rotate: keep only the last max_snapshots entries.
        Write atomically: write to scan_history.json.tmp, rename to scan_history.json.
        Thread-safe: acquire a file lock before writing (filelock library).
        """
        ...

    def detect(self, findings: list[dict]) -> dict:
        """
        Compare latest two snapshots in scan_history.json.

        If < 2 snapshots: returns {"drift": None, "reason": "insufficient history"}

        Otherwise returns:
            {
                "new_findings": list[dict],        # findings in latest not in previous
                "resolved_findings": list[dict],   # findings in previous not in latest
                "waste_delta": float,              # positive = more waste, negative = improved
                "critical_delta": int,             # change in critical finding count
                "narrative": str,                  # LLM-generated plain English summary
                "compared_scans": [scan_id_old, scan_id_new]
            }

        Findings matched across snapshots by (resource_id, check_type) pair.
        """
        ...
```

**Responsibilities**:

- Maintain `scan_history.json` with atomic writes (filelock)
- Keep only last 30 snapshots (rotate old entries)
- Compare consecutive scans for new/resolved findings by (resource_id, check_type)
- Generate LLM narrative explaining drift (2-3 sentences, plain text)

- save_snapshot logs errors to stderr, never raises
- detect returns {drift: None, reason: "error"} on failure, never raises

---

### Component 8: MultiAccountOrchestrator (Phase C)

**Purpose**: Runs concurrent audits across multiple AWS accounts defined in `accounts.json`. Uses ThreadPoolExecutor.

**Interface**:

```python
class MultiAccountOrchestrator:
    def __init__(
        self,
        accounts_path: Path | None = None,   # default: project_root/accounts.json
        max_workers: int = 5,
    ):
        ...

    def run_all(self) -> dict:
        """
        Execute audits across all configured accounts concurrently.

        Returns:
            {
                "accounts_scanned": int,
                "total_findings": int,
                "total_waste": float,
                "critical_count": int,
                "by_account": [
                    {
                        "account_id": str,
                        "account_name": str,
                        "priority": str,
                        "findings": list[dict],
                        "waste": float,
                        "critical_count": int,

        """
        ...

    def load_accounts(self) -> list[dict]:
        """Load accounts from accounts.json."""
        ...
```

**Responsibilities**:

- Load account configurations from `accounts.json`
- Run concurrent audits via ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)
- Each account scan uses a separate Orchestrator instance with isolated findings_store: `findings_store_{account_id}.json`
- Sort by_account by priority: high first, then medium, then low
- Deduplicate cross_account_duplicates by (resource_type, check_type) pairs
- Inject account_id field into all findings before aggregation
- Isolate failures per account (one failure doesn't stop others)
- Missing accounts.json returns empty result dict, never raises

---

### Component 9: JanitorScheduler (Phase C)

**Purpose**: Provides cron-based automated scans using APScheduler. Lives at project root as `scheduler.py` (not in agents/). Manages scheduler lifecycle.

**Interface**:

```python
# scheduler.py (project root)

class JanitorScheduler:
    def __init__(self, project_root: Path | None = None):
        ...

    def start(self) -> None:
        """
        Start the background scheduler. Non-blocking.

        """
        ...

    def stop(self) -> None:
        """Stop the scheduler gracefully."""
        ...

    def get_status(self) -> dict:

**Responsibilities**:

- Read schedule from JANITOR_SCHEDULE env var (cron syntax, default "0 6 ** *")
- start() is non-blocking, reads cron from env var (no arguments)
- On startup with no scan history: run one scan immediately
- On each trigger: run Orchestrator.execute_audit(), save to scan_history.json
- Log each run completion to scheduler.log at project root
- Started as a daemon thread from app.py (daemon=True, exits with main process)
- Thread-safe state management
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT

## Data Models

### QueryInterpreter Output Schema

```python
# Not a dataclass — returned as a plain dict from interpret()
{
    "resource_types": list[str],    # subset of ["elasticache", "ebs", "ec2"]; empty = all
    "check_types": list[str],       # subset of ["security_group", "encryption", "public_access"]; empty = all
    "min_idle_days": int,           # default 7
    "intent_summary": str,          # one sentence shown in UI
    "confidence": float             # 0.0–1.0
}
```

**Validation Rules**:

- `resource_types` items must be in {"elasticache", "ebs", "ec2"} or empty list
- `check_types` items must be in {"security_group", "encryption", "public_access"} or empty list
- `min_idle_days` >= 0
- `confidence` in [0.0, 1.0]

### AccountConfig (Multi-Account)

```python
# accounts.json schema — each entry:
{
    "account_id": str,         # e.g. "123456789012"
    "account_name": str,       # e.g. "Production"
    "role_arn": str,           # e.g. "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CloudJanitorReadOnly"
    "region": str,             # e.g. "us-east-1" (scalar, not list)
    "priority": str            # "high" | "medium" | "low"
}
```

**Validation Rules**:

- `account_id` must be 12-digit string
- `role_arn` must match `arn:aws:iam::\d{12}:role/.+`
- `region` must be a valid AWS region code (scalar string)
- `priority` must be one of: "high", "medium", "low"

### DriftSnapshot (scan_history.json entry)

```python
# Each entry in the scan_history.json snapshots array:
{
    "scan_id": str,
    "timestamp": str,           # ISO format
    "findings": list[dict],     # full findings list
    "anomalies": list[dict],    # anomaly dicts
    "total_waste": float        # sum of cost_estimate_monthly
}
```

### Policy (policies/{policy_id}.json)

```python
{
    "policy_id": str,              # slug, e.g. "policy-s3-public-access-check"
    "policy_name": str,
    "resource_types": list[str],   # non-empty
    "check_type": str,             # one of: security_group, encryption, public_access, idle_resource
    "check_logic_description": str,
    "rationale": str,
    "query": str,                  # NL query for QueryInterpreter
    "generated_at": str,           # ISO timestamp
    "incident_hash": str,          # sha256[:8] of incident_description
    "version": 1
}
```

**Validation Rules**:

- `policy_id` must be a slug string
- `check_type` in {"security_group", "encryption", "public_access", "idle_resource"}
- `resource_types` must be non-empty list

## Algorithmic Pseudocode

### Algorithm 1: Natural Language Query Interpretation

```python
def interpret(query: str, model: str = "claude-haiku-4-5") -> dict:
    """Map free-text to structured scan parameters via LLM."""
    ...
```

**Preconditions:**

- `query` is a string (may be empty — returns safe defaults)
- Anthropic API key is available in environment
- `model` is a valid Anthropic model identifier

**Postconditions:**

- Returns dict with keys: resource_types, check_types, min_idle_days, intent_summary, confidence
- On LLM failure: returns safe defaults ([], [], 7, "Could not interpret query.", 0.0)
- `confidence` field reflects LLM's certainty in parsing
- Never raises an exception

**Algorithm:**

```python
ALGORITHM interpret(query)
INPUT: query: str — natural language scan request
OUTPUT: dict with {resource_types, check_types, min_idle_days, intent_summary, confidence}

BEGIN
    SAFE_DEFAULT = {
        "resource_types": [],
        "check_types": [],
        "min_idle_days": 7,
        "intent_summary": "Could not interpret query.",
        "confidence": 0.0
    }

    IF query is empty or whitespace:
        RETURN SAFE_DEFAULT

    prompt = PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(query=query)

    TRY:
        response = anthropic_client.messages.create(
            model=model,
            max_tokens=256,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
        )
        parsed = json.loads(response.content[0].text)
        
        # Validate and sanitize
        params = {
            "resource_types": [r for r in parsed.get("resource_types", []) if r in VALID_RESOURCE_TYPES],
            "check_types": [c for c in parsed.get("check_types", []) if c in VALID_CHECK_TYPES],
            "min_idle_days": max(0, int(parsed.get("min_idle_days", 7))),
            "intent_summary": str(parsed.get("intent_summary", "Scan requested.")),
            "confidence": min(1.0, max(0.0, float(parsed.get("confidence", 0.5))))
        }
        RETURN params
    EXCEPT Exception:
        RETURN SAFE_DEFAULT
END
```

### Algorithm 2: Anomaly Detection (Post-Scan)

```python
def detect(resources: list[dict], findings: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
    """Flag suspicious resources not caught by rules. Returns flat list of anomaly dicts."""
    ...
```

**Preconditions:**

- `resources` is a valid list of resource dicts from MCP (may be empty)
- `findings` is a list of already-identified findings from FinOps + SecOps
- Anthropic API available

**Postconditions:**

- Returns a flat list of anomaly dicts (not wrapped in a dict)
- Each anomaly has: anomaly_id, resource_id, anomaly_type, description, severity, evidence
- Never includes resources already in findings (deduplicates by resource_id)
- Never raises — returns [] on any failure

**Algorithm:**

```python
ALGORITHM detect(resources, findings)
INPUT: resources: list[dict], findings: list[dict]
OUTPUT: list[dict] — flat list of anomaly dicts

BEGIN
    already_flagged_ids = {f["resource_id"] for f in findings}
    unflagged_resources = [r for r in resources if r.get("id", r.get("resource_id")) not in already_flagged_ids]

    IF len(unflagged_resources) == 0:
        RETURN []

    prompt = ANOMALY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(
        already_flagged_ids=list(already_flagged_ids),
        resources_json=json.dumps(unflagged_resources[:50])
    )

    TRY:
        response = call_llm(prompt)
        anomalies = json.loads(response)
        
        # Filter: only keep anomalies for resources not already flagged
        valid_anomalies = [a for a in anomalies if a["resource_id"] not in already_flagged_ids]
        
        RETURN valid_anomalies
    EXCEPT Exception:
        RETURN []
END
```

### Algorithm 3: Drift Detection with Atomic Write

```python
def save_snapshot(scan_id: str, findings: list[dict], anomalies: list[dict], total_waste: float) -> None:
    """Persist snapshot to scan_history.json atomically."""
    ...

def detect(findings: list[dict]) -> dict:
    """Compare latest two snapshots and generate narrative."""
    ...
```

**Preconditions:**

- `findings` is a valid list of Finding dicts
- history_path points to scan_history.json location (may not exist yet)
- filelock library available

**Postconditions:**

- scan_history.json is updated atomically (write to .tmp, rename)
- Only last 30 snapshots kept (rotate oldest)
- detect() returns drift report or {drift: None, reason: "insufficient history"}
- Findings matched across snapshots by (resource_id, check_type) pair
- File lock is always released (even on error)
- save_snapshot never raises (logs to stderr)
- detect never raises (returns {drift: None, reason: "error"})

**Algorithm:**

```python
ALGORITHM save_snapshot(scan_id, findings, anomalies, total_waste)
INPUT: scan_id: str, findings: list[dict], anomalies: list[dict], total_waste: float
OUTPUT: None (writes to scan_history.json)

            }
            history.append(snapshot)

            # Rotate: keep only last max_snapshots (30)
            IF len(history) > 30:
                history = history[-30:]

            # Atomic write: tmp then rename
            tmp_path = history_path.with_suffix(".json.tmp")
            tmp_path.write_text(json.dumps(history, indent=2))
            tmp_path.rename(history_path)
    EXCEPT Exception AS e:
        sys.stderr.write(f"save_snapshot error: {e}\n")
END

ALGORITHM detect(findings)
INPUT: findings: list[dict]
OUTPUT: drift report dict

BEGIN
    TRY:
        IF NOT history_path.exists():
            RETURN {"drift": None, "reason": "insufficient history"}

        history = json.loads(history_path.read_text())

        )

        # Generate narrative via LLM
        narrative = generate_drift_narrative(new_findings, resolved_findings, waste_delta, critical_delta)

### Algorithm 4: Multi-Account Concurrent Execution

```python
def run_all(accounts_path: Path, max_workers: int = 5) -> dict:
    """Execute audits concurrently across accounts."""
    ...
```

**Preconditions:**

- `accounts_path` points to valid accounts.json (or file not found → empty result)
- `max_workers` > 0
- Each account in accounts.json has: account_id, account_name, role_arn, region, priority

**Postconditions:**

- All accounts are audited (or error recorded per-account)
- Single account failure does not block others
- Results aggregated across all accounts with account_id injected into each finding
- by_account sorted by priority: high first, then medium, then low
- Thread safety maintained via isolated Orchestrator instances with separate findings stores

**Algorithm:**

```python
ALGORITHM run_all(accounts_path, max_workers)

**Loop Invariants:**

- For the futures loop: all completed futures have been processed
- by_account grows monotonically (one entry per completed future)

### Algorithm 5: Scheduled Scans (APScheduler)

```python
def start(self) -> None:
    """Start cron-based automated scans. Reads schedule from JANITOR_SCHEDULE env var."""
    ...
```

**Preconditions:**

- JANITOR_SCHEDULE env var contains valid cron syntax (5-field) or uses default "0 6 ** *"
- APScheduler library available
- project_root is set

**Postconditions:**

- BackgroundScheduler is running with configured trigger
- `get_status()` returns running=True
- Scheduler shuts down cleanly on application exit
- If no scan has run today, runs one immediately on start
- Multiple `start()` calls are idempotent (stops previous, starts new)t()` calls are idempotent (stops previous, starts new)

**Algorithm:**

```python
ALGORITHM start(self)
INPUT: None (reads JANITOR_SCHEDULE from env var)
OUTPUT: None (starts background scheduler)

BEGIN
    cron_expression = os.environ.get("JANITOR_SCHEDULE", "0 6 * * *")

### Algorithm 6: Policy From Incident

```python
def generate(incident_description: str) -> list[dict]:
    """Generate preventive policies from incident description. Returns list."""
    ...
```

**Preconditions:**

- `incident_description` is a string (empty → returns [])
- Anthropic API available
- `policies/` directory exists or can be created

**Postconditions:**

- Returns list of policy dicts (3-5 items on success, [] on failure)
- Each policy JSON file written to `policies/<policy_id>.json`
- If same incident_hash already exists on disk, returns existing policies without re-generating
- On LLM failure: returns [], no files written
- Input >2000 chars is truncated before LLM call
- Never raises

**Algorithm:**

```python
ALGORITHM generate(incident_description)
INPUT: incident_description: str
OUTPUT: list[dict] — list of policy dicts

BEGIN
    IF incident_description is empty or whitespace:
        RETURN []

## Error Handling

### Error Scenario 1: LLM API Unavailable

**Condition**: Anthropic API returns connection error, timeout, or rate limit
**Response**: All AI agents catch the exception and return safe defaults
**Recovery**:

- QueryInterpreter → returns empty filters (full scan)
- RemediationExplainer → returns generic template explanation
- PolicySuggester → returns empty suggestions list
- AnomalyDetector → returns empty anomalies
- DriftDetector → returns no-drift report (narrative = "")
- IncidentPolicyGenerator → returns []
- ResourceTagger → returns "unknown" tags with confidence 0.0

### Error Scenario 2: Invalid JSON from LLM

**Condition**: LLM returns malformed or unparseable JSON
**Response**: Same safe-default pattern as API unavailable
**Recovery**: Log warning, return defaults. No retry (avoid cascading latency).

### Error Scenario 3: scan_history.json Locked (Drift)

**Condition**: filelock timeout (another process holds the lock)
**Response**: DriftDetector returns no-drift report without recording
**Recovery**: Next scan attempt will succeed when lock is released. Warning logged.

### Error Scenario 4: accounts.json Missing/Invalid (Multi-Account)

**Condition**: File doesn't exist or contains invalid JSON
**Response**: MultiAccountOrchestrator returns error with 0 accounts audited
**Recovery**: User must create/fix accounts.json. Meaningful error message surfaced in UI.

### Error Scenario 5: Single Account Failure (Multi-Account)

**Condition**: One account's audit raises an exception
**Response**: Exception caught per-account; other accounts continue
**Recovery**: Failed account recorded with error message in results_by_account

### Error Scenario 6: Scheduler Job Failure

**Condition**: Scheduled audit execution raises an exception
**Response**: Exception caught in _execute_scheduled_audit; recorded in history
**Recovery**: Scheduler continues running; next trigger fires normally

### Error Scenario 7: policies/ Directory Not Writable

**Condition**: Permission error when writing policy JSON
**Response**: IncidentPolicyGenerator returns [] (empty list)
**Recovery**: User must fix directory permissions. Error logged to stderr.

### Error Scenario 8: JANITOR_BACKEND=fixture with New Tools

**Condition**: New MCP tools called when backend is fixture
**Response**: FixtureProvider returns appropriate mock data for all new tools
**Recovery**: All features work in fixture mode — no live AWS required for development

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach

Each new agent class requires:

1. **Known expected value test**: Concrete input → concrete expected output (not derived from function under test)
2. **Negative test**: Invalid input → graceful handling (no raise, safe defaults)
3. **Schema validation**: Output dicts checked for required keys and correct types
4. **LLM mocking**: Mock `anthropic.Anthropic.messages.create` — never the agent method itself

Key test files:

- `tests/test_query_interpreter.py`
- `tests/test_explainer.py`
- `tests/test_policy_suggester.py`
- `tests/test_tagger.py`
- `tests/test_anomaly_detector.py`
- `tests/test_incident_policy_generator.py`
- `tests/test_drift_detector.py`
- `tests/test_multi_account_orchestrator.py`
- `tests/test_scheduler.py`

### Property-Based Testing Approach

**Property Test Library**: hypothesis

Properties to test:

- QueryInterpreter: confidence always in [0, 1], resource_type always valid, never raises
- AnomalyDetector: anomaly resource_ids disjoint from finding resource_ids
- DriftDetector: has_drift consistency with sub-fields
- MultiAccountOrchestrator: result count == enabled account count
- All agents: never raise on any string input

### Integration Testing Approach

- `tests/test_orchestrator_integration.py`: Full pipeline with NL query → scan → anomaly → drift
- `tests/test_mcp_tools_phase_bc.py`: All new MCP tools callable and return valid schemas
- `tests/test_fixture_backend.py`: All features work with JANITOR_BACKEND=fixture
- `tests/test_scheduler_lifecycle.py`: Start → execute → pause → resume → stop

## Performance Considerations

### LLM Call Latency

- All LLM calls use claude-haiku-4-5 (fastest model) for sub-second responses
- Session state caching in `app.py` prevents redundant LLM calls on Streamlit rerenders
- Cache keyed by: (agent_name, input_hash) → result
- Cache invalidated on new audit execution

### Multi-Account Concurrency

- ThreadPoolExecutor with configurable `max_workers` (default: 4)
- Each account audit runs in isolated thread with own Orchestrator instance
- No shared mutable state between threads
- Timeout per account (300s) prevents blocking on stalled accounts

### Drift Detection I/O

- scan_history.json uses filelock to prevent corruption under concurrent access
- Atomic writes: write to temp file → rename (atomic on POSIX)
- History capped at last 30 snapshots to prevent unbounded growth
- Lock timeout of 10 seconds prevents deadlock

### Scheduler Resource Usage

- APScheduler BackgroundScheduler uses minimal thread overhead
- Single audit job running at a time (no concurrent scheduled runs)
- History list capped at 1000 entries

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management

- Anthropic API key read from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
- Never logged, never included in findings or outputs
- All AI agents fail gracefully if key missing (safe defaults)

### LLM Output Sanitization

- All LLM responses parsed as JSON — no code execution
- Parsed values validated against allowlists (resource types, severities)
- Free-text fields (narratives, explanations) treated as display-only

### Multi-Account Role Assumption

- Role ARNs validated against `arn:aws:iam::\d{12}:role/.+` pattern
- No credential storage — uses STS AssumeRole with session tokens
- Credentials scoped to individual audit execution (not persisted)

### Policy File Safety

- Policies written as JSON only (no executable content)
- Policy directory path validated (no path traversal)
- Policies require manual review before enforcement
