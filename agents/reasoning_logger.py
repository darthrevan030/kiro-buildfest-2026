"""Structured JSON event logger for agent reasoning traces.

Provides a streaming JSONL logger that each agent uses to emit structured
decision events during audit execution. The log file is truncated at the
start of each new audit run and appended to sequentially during the run.

Filesystem errors are printed to stderr and never raised — agent execution
must not be interrupted by logging failures.

Usage:
    from agents.reasoning_logger import ReasoningLogger

    logger = ReasoningLogger()
    logger.truncate()
    logger.emit("finops_auditor", "check", "cache-prod-legacy-01", "Checking idle duration")
